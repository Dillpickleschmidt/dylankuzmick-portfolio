# On the Patience of Materials

I took up woodworking last year, and it has quietly changed how I think about software. Wood has grain — it wants to be cut in certain directions, shaped in certain ways. Fight the grain and the wood splits. Work with it and the material almost guides your hand.

Code has grain too. Every language, every framework, every library has natural patterns — ways it wants to be used. The best code I've written has always been code that followed the grain of its tools. The worst has been code that fought against them, bending abstractions into shapes they were never meant to hold.

There's a Japanese concept called *shizen* — naturalness, the absence of pretense or artificiality. I think about this when I write software. Does this architecture feel natural? Does this API feel like it grew organically from the problem, or does it feel bolted on? The answers guide better decisions than any design pattern book.
