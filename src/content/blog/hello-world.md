# On the Patience of Materials

## Learning from Wood

I took up woodworking last year, and it has quietly changed how I think about software. Wood has grain — it wants to be cut in certain directions, shaped in certain ways. Fight the grain and the wood splits. Work with it and the material almost guides your hand.

## The Grain of Code

Code has grain too. Every language, every framework, every library has natural patterns — ways it wants to be used. The best code I've written has always been code that followed the grain of its tools. The worst has been code that fought against them, bending abstractions into shapes they were never meant to hold.

## Shizen: Naturalness

There's a Japanese concept called *shizen* — naturalness, the absence of pretense or artificiality. I think about this when I write software. Does this architecture feel natural? Does this API feel like it grew organically from the problem, or does it feel bolted on? The answers guide better decisions than any design pattern book.

## Patience as Practice

The best woodworkers I've met share a quality with the best engineers: they're patient. They measure twice. They let the glue dry. They don't rush the finish. In a world that celebrates shipping fast, there's something radical about taking the time to do things right — about respecting the material enough to let it guide your hand.
