# Walking as a Development Practice

## The Trail as Debugger

When I'm stuck on a hard problem, I go for a walk. Not a quick lap around the block — a proper walk, an hour or more, preferably on a trail with trees and uneven ground. The physical act of walking engages just enough of my conscious mind that the subconscious can work on the problem undisturbed.

## The Science Behind It

This isn't mysticism. There's research behind it: walking increases blood flow to the brain, and the mild cognitive load of navigating terrain occupies the prefrontal cortex just enough to let the default mode network — the brain's background processing system — do its thing. Solutions that felt impossible at the keyboard arrive fully formed on the trail.

## Walks as First-Class Work

I've started treating walks as a first-class development practice, not a break from work. My calendar has "walk" blocks alongside standups and code reviews. My colleagues have learned that if I say "I need to walk on this," I'll come back with an approach that's better than anything I'd have produced staring at a screen.
