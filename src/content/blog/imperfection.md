# In Praise of Imperfection

## The Beauty of Wabi-Sabi

In Japanese aesthetics, *wabi-sabi* is the beauty of imperfection — the cracked glaze on a tea bowl, the weathered surface of a wooden beam, the asymmetry of a hand-thrown pot. These imperfections aren't flaws to be hidden; they're evidence of a thing's history, its making, its life.

## The Pursuit of Pixel-Perfection

Most software strives for the opposite: pixel-perfect alignment, consistent behavior, polished surfaces. And that's fine — reliability matters. But I wonder if we've lost something in the pursuit of perfection. The hand-drawn icon has more character than the geometric one. The slightly irregular grid feels more human than the mathematical one.

## Software with Texture

I'm not advocating for buggy software. I'm advocating for software that acknowledges it was made by humans, for humans. Software that has texture and personality instead of the flat, interchangeable smoothness that dominates modern interfaces.
