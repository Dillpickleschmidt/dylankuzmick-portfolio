# Digital Gardens and Slow Growth

## Streams vs. Gardens

A blog is a stream — posts flow by in chronological order, each one a finished piece, never to be revisited. A digital garden is different. It's a collection of notes at varying stages of maturity, interconnected, constantly evolving. Some are seedlings — half-formed ideas. Others are evergreen — well-developed thoughts that have been pruned and shaped over time.

## A Year of Gardening

I've been tending a digital garden for about a year now, and the change in how I think has been profound. Without the pressure to publish finished pieces, I write more freely. Ideas that would have been too small for a blog post become seeds in the garden. Over time, those seeds connect, cross-pollinate, and grow into something richer than any single post could have been.

## The Maintenance Metaphor

The garden metaphor isn't just poetic — it's structural. Like a real garden, a digital garden requires regular maintenance: watering (adding new connections), pruning (removing outdated ideas), and patience. The best insights emerge not from a single session of intense writing, but from the slow accumulation of attention over months.
