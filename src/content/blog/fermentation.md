# Fermentation and Feedback Loops

I've been making sourdough bread for three years. The process is humbling: mix flour and water, wait. Feed the starter, wait. Shape the dough, wait. The baker doesn't make the bread — the microorganisms do. The baker creates conditions for transformation and then steps back.

Software development has a similar rhythm, though we rarely acknowledge it. The best architectures aren't designed in a single burst of genius — they ferment. You set up the initial conditions (a clean abstraction, a well-defined interface), and then you let the system evolve through use, feedback, and iteration. The code that survives multiple rounds of real-world contact is the code that's truly ready.

Both fermentation and software development require what I think of as *productive patience* — the ability to resist the urge to intervene, to trust the process, to let time do its work. In a culture that celebrates speed and disruption, this kind of patience is radical.
